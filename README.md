### 📘LeetCode Daily Practice – Multiple Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode Daily Problem Solving repository!

Here, I document my daily progress solving LeetCode problems with a focus on writing multiple solutions using different data structures, such as:

✅ Arrays

✅ Stacks

✅ Queues

✅ Linked Lists

### 📂 Structure

Each folder or file in this repository includes:

✅ Problem description or title

✅ One or more solutions, using different approaches or data structures

✅ Comments explaining the logic and thought process

### 🎯 Goals
Improve my problem-solving skills

Understand and compare different data structure implementations

Track my daily consistency with LeetCode challenges

Build a strong reference for interview preparation

Data Structures Covered

Data Structure	Description

Array	Basic operations, sliding window, two pointers, etc.

Stack	Valid parentheses, next greater element, etc.

Queue	BFS, sliding window max, etc.

Linked List	Reversals, cycle detection, merging, etc.

### 🛠️ How to Use
